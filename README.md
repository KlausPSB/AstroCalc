# AstroCalc
Simple android app code to compute position of sun,moon, and satellites, for purposes of tracking.

Made by gathering astronomical code from various sources (documented in the code) and adjusting it to make it work.

For the moment the app displays real time sun position and accepts your location in the form of a 6-letter maidenhead locator.

No binary provided, just load this project in Android studio and use run or debug.
